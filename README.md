# Visualizing 2014 ACS Risk Factors with Interactive D3 Scatterplot

This project is an introduction and exploration of some of D3's interactive plotting capabilities. The dataset being used is the 2014 American Community Survery 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau and ACS Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. 

6 risk factors are plotted in an interactive scatterplot, where the user can select which variables to plot against each other.
